<u><h4>Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm</h4></u>

 <p>Cryptography is a current way to securely communicate information. To communicate information more securely and in less noticeable ways it can be concealed inside carrier files (mostly media files). Media files refers to images, video, & audio files. The process of hiding messages inside media files is called Steganography. We can hide from plain text to executable files inside an apt and capable media file. Taking to the next level in the last few years this technique also attracted several Malware developers. Several malwares (such as DNSChanger, Vawtrak) have successfully deployed this technique to launch their nefarious software on their victims. This experiment introduces students to the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm, one of the basic techniques to hide information inside media files. Use the same technique and show how they may be used by a malware in a real-world scenario. </p>
